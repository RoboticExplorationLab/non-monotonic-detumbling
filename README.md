# Non-monotonic Detumbling

Simulation experiments corresponding to the paper "B-Dot Is Not Optimal: Better Detumbling with Non-monotonic Lyapunov Functions"

## Organization
This repository contains its own Julia environment, specified by the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files. To activate the environment, start Julia in the project root directory and run `julia> ] activate .`

The directories in this project serve the following purposes:
* `src`: Julia source code
* `scripts`: Standalone Julia scripts that calls code in `src` to run experiments, etc. Scripts that start with `plot_*` read data from `data` and generate figure files in `figs`.
* `figs`: Figures generated by scripts
* `data`: Data generated by scripts
